# Rolling Rhino Remix - Creation Script
The Rolling Rhino Remix creation script generates a fresh disk image from files in https://github.com/rollingrhinoremix/distro.

This script follows the steps in our guide on how to manually create your own disk image, which can be found [here](https://rollingrhinoremix.github.io/docs-create).

## How to use the script

To use the script you will first need to initialise Cubic, the steps can be found [here](https://rollingrhinoremix.github.io/docs-create). once that has been done you will need to follow the steps below:
- Install Git in the Cubic terminal with `apt install git`.
- Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/rollingrhinoremix/creation_script`.
- Once this has been done please go into the directory with `cd ~/creation_script`.
